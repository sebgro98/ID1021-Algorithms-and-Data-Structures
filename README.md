Content and learning outcomes
Course contents
Basic algorithm analysis:

Simpler analysis with respect to the resource needs of algorithms in the form of time and memory.
Fundamental algorithms:

simple numerical algorithms
sequential and binary search algorithms
Depth first search and Width first search.
sorting algorithms: selection sorting, insertion sorting, Quicksort, heapsort, mergesort.
Fundamental data structures:

linear lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, binary tree, heaps, binary search trees and problem trees.
Program Design:

design and implementation of programmes that use basic algorithms and data structures to solve computer science problems.
Intended learning outcomes
On completion of the course, students should be able to

describe a number of common algorithms for search and sorting and their properties
compare algorithms with regard to time and memory usage
implement data structures as linear lists stacks, queues, hash tables, binary tree and search trees
identify problems where the data structures above are useful and design simple algorithms with these
write programmes that use algorithms and data structures by means of good programming principles such as systematic tests and abstraction
model problems as search problems and implement algorithms for breadth-first-search, depth-first-search or best-first-search
in order to

be able to design programmes that solve problems by using commonly occurring algorithms and data structures
acquire sufficient prior knowledge to be able to take advanced courses in computer science.
